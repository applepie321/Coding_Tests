# Bouncing Ball

# A child is playing with a ball on the nth floor of a tall building. 
# The height of this floor above ground level, h, is known.

# He drops the ball out of the window. The ball bounces (for example), 
# to two-thirds of its height (a bounce of 0.66).

# His mother looks out of a window 1.5 meters from the ground.

# How many times will the mother see the ball pass in front of her window

# Three conditions must be met for a valid experiment:
# Float parameter "h" in meters must be greater than 0
# Float parameter "bounce" must be greater than 0 and less than 1
# Float parameter "window" must be less than h.
# If all three conditions above are fulfilled, 
# return a positive integer, otherwise return -1.

# Note:
# The ball can only be seen if the height of the rebounding ball
#  is strictly greater than the window parameter.



def bouncing_ball(h, bounce, window):
    if h <= 0 or bounce <= 0 or bounce >= 1 or window >= h:
        return -1
    counter = -1
    while h > window:
        h = h * bounce
        counter += 2
    return counter



# Best practice

def bouncingBall(h, bounce, window):
    if not 0 < bounce < 1: return -1
    count = 0
    while h > window:
        count += 1
        h *= bounce
        if h > window: count += 1
    return count or -1



# Clever

    seen = -1
    
    if 0 < bounce < 1:
        while h > window > 0:
            seen += 2
            h *= bounce
    
    return seen

    # Solve equation for f(x) = window, using logarithms
    bounces = math.log(window / h, bounce)
    # Get actual number of bounces that still puts the ball above window height

    # plus one for the initial drop past window, before first bounce
    passes = exactBounces * 2 + 1
